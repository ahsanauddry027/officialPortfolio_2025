# Formspree Setup (Alternative to EmailJS)

Since EmailJS is having issues, here's how to set up Formspree as a reliable alternative:

## Step 1: Create Formspree Account

1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Click "Get Started" and create a free account
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Create a New Form

1. In your Formspree dashboard, click "New Form"
2. Give it a name like "Portfolio Contact"
3. Set the email to: `ahsanauddry.ndc@gmail.com`
4. **Copy the form endpoint** (looks like `https://formspree.io/f/abc123def`)

## Step 3: Update Contact Form

I'll update the ContactForm component to use Formspree instead of EmailJS.

## Benefits of Formspree:

- ✅ **More reliable** than EmailJS
- ✅ **No configuration needed** - just the endpoint
- ✅ **Better error handling**
- ✅ **Spam protection** built-in
- ✅ **Free tier**: 50 submissions per month
- ✅ **Works immediately** - no template setup needed

## Current Status:

EmailJS is failing with empty error objects, which suggests:

- Network connectivity issues
- EmailJS service problems
- Configuration mismatch

Formspree will be much more reliable and easier to set up.

Would you like me to:

1. **Set up Formspree** (recommended - more reliable)
2. **Continue debugging EmailJS** (if you prefer to stick with it)
3. **Set up both** (Formspree as primary, EmailJS as backup)
